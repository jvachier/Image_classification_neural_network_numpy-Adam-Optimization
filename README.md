My goal is to classify 10 digits from 0 to 9 with Neural Networks using Numpy only. The training set (train.csv) contains 42000 labelled pictures and the testing set (test.csv) contains 28000 non-labelled pictures. Each picture has 784 pixels ( 28Ã—28 ) and is the input size of the network. (data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)  <br>

The Network is built using two hidden layers using Adam optimization. The first layer contains 128 neurons, the second layer 40 neurons and the output layer 10 neurons. <br>

In this Network, the activation function for the intermediate layers is ReLu and the accuracy is computed. Moreover, the cost function used is the mean squared error (MSE). <br>

This Network is optimized using Adam and compared with another Network without optimization. The learning rate is given by $\alpha$. <br>

The Networks are first trained independently on the training set and then tested using the test set. The accuracy reaches 100% for the Network optimized with Adam. <br>
